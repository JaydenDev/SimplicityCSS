# SimplicityCSS
A simple, configurable, readable, and forkable stylesheet for use in any case, environment, or for any task.

# Easily make your website beautiful
Just apply the stylesheet, and your website will look professional, clean, and fast!

# Easy configuration
No need to know any CSS! Just edit the config file (its a css file but its just variables) and edit the values to your liking!

# Latest Build (21.10.16-dev) (Build 21101644)
Thanks MystPi for PR #2 (Fixed CSS Variables) SimplicityCSS can now be used for websites!
# Discontinued software
Thankyou contributors of the project, for helping SimplicityCSS fly through difficulties. But this software is now discontinued!
